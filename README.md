# SENSITIVE- DATA - CLASSIFICATION - USING - DEEP LEARNING

A Machine Learning model that distinguishes between sensitive and non-sensitive data.
Every person or business can use a model to determine whether or not the photographs they are viewing include sensitive information, preventing the information from being compromised or lost.

ABSTRACT

Depending on the degree of sensitivity and nature of the information, loss, misuse, modification, or unauthorised access to sensitive information may have a negative impact on an individual's privacy or welfare, a company's trade secrets, or even the security and international relations of a country. In order to classify the information in the photos as sensitive or non-sensitive, we have developed a machine learning algorithm.

CONCLUSION

We can conclude how a deeplearning model can be used to implement this model of sensitive data classification.
Out of all the algorithms like the logistic model, KNN, SVM,CNN, etc., it was found that a Convolutional Neural Network is most suitable for this model of sensitive image classification. CNN is considered because it gives more accuracy as compared to the others algorithms.
